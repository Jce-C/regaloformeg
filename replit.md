# Photo Cascade Love Display

## Overview

This is a romantic photo display application that creates a cascading visual effect with love messages, heart symbols, and uploaded photos. The app features a starfield background with animated elements falling like a digital waterfall. Users can upload photos that get integrated into the animated cascade along with predefined love messages in Spanish ("I love you so much baby♡"). The application uses a full-stack architecture with React frontend and Express backend, designed for a personalized romantic experience.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing with single page (Home) and 404 handling
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library for consistent design system
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and API caching
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Theme**: Custom dark theme with neon pink/orange color scheme and CSS variables for theming

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript running on Node.js
- **API Design**: RESTful API with file upload capabilities using multer middleware
- **File Handling**: Multer for multipart form data processing with memory storage and file system persistence
- **Development Setup**: Hot reloading with Vite integration for development mode
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware with proper HTTP status codes
- **Request Logging**: Custom middleware for API request logging with response tracking

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Storage**: In-memory storage using Map data structure for photo metadata
- **File Storage**: Local file system storage in `/uploads` directory for uploaded images
- **Database Schema**: Drizzle ORM schema defined for PostgreSQL with photos table structure
- **Data Models**: TypeScript interfaces for Photo and InsertPhoto types with Zod validation

### File Upload System
- **Upload Endpoint**: POST `/api/photos` with multipart form data support
- **File Validation**: Image file type restriction with 10MB size limit
- **Storage Strategy**: Files saved with timestamp-prefixed filenames to prevent conflicts
- **Serving**: Static file serving for uploaded images via Express static middleware

### Animation System
- **Cascade Component**: Custom React component managing animated falling elements
- **Element Types**: Three types of falling items - love messages, photos, and heart symbols
